Final Year Project Repository

This is the inner-workings of my final year project at Royal Holloway Uni which was to find solutions for the vertex cover problem.

There are three different approaches to the vertex cover problem yielding "good enough" results:
- Heuristic approach
- Approximation approach
- Alom's approach
- BActracking approach (in development)
